## Work Completed

### 1. Critical Fix: Platform Registration ✅
**Issue:** Shopify connector wasn't being registered, causing "Failed to fetch" error
**Fix Applied:**

- Enhanced `apps/api/app/api/platforms/route.ts` with better platform metadata
- Both Shopify and Amazon platforms now registered

### 2. Pushed Changes to Repository ✅
**Commit:** `d9c5366 - fix: Register Shopify connector in platform registry`
**Files Changed:** 7 files, 421 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)
**Includes:**
- Code fix for platform registration
- Documentation updates (PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md, AGENT_C_HANDOFF.md, AGENT_STATUS.md)
- New documentation files:
  - AGENT_C_INTEGRATIONS_FIX.md
  - QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Code Complete
- Shopify connector auto-registers on API server start
- Platform metadata includes names and descriptions
- Changes pushed to GitHub

### ⏳ Testing Required
- API server needs restart to apply fix
- Test integrations page at `/p/[slug]/integrations`
- Verify both Shopify and Amazon appear in list
- Test platform connection flows

---

## Existing Integration Flow Analysis

### What Works:
1. **Main Integrations Page** (`/p/[slug]/integrations/page.tsx`)
   - Lists available platforms
   - Shows connection status
   - Has connect/manage buttons

2. **Platform-Specific Pages**:
   - **Shopify:** `/p/[slug]/integrations/shopify/page.tsx`
     - Handles not-connected state (shows connection UI)
     - Shows status when connected
     - Has sync controls
   - **Amazon:** `/p/[slug]/integrations/amazon/page.tsx`
     - Shows pricing and competitive tools

3. **Onboarding Pages:**
   - Welcome page (`/onboarding/page.tsx`)
   - Project creation (`/onboarding/project/page.tsx`)
   - Platform selection (`/onboarding/platform/page.tsx`)

### What Needs Work:

#### 1. Platform Connection Flow
**Issue:** When users click "Connect" from PlatformCard, they go to platform-specific page
- ✅ Shopify page handles "not connected" state
- ⚠️ Amazon page doesn't have connection UI yet

**Action Needed:**
- Update Amazon integration page to handle connection state
- Add connection UI similar to Shopify

#### 2. PlatformCard "Connect" Button
**Current:** Links to `/p/[slug]/integrations/{platform}`
**Should:** Guide user through connection process
- For Shopify: OAuth flow
- For Amazon: Credentials input

#### 3. Integration Status API
**Current:** Uses `/api/integrations/shopify/status` (old endpoint)
**Should:** Use unified `/api/platforms/{platform}?project={slug}` endpoint
- Current implementation is fragmented
- Need to migrate to unified platforms API

## Next Steps for Agent C

### Immediate (Today):
1. ✅ **Restart API server** to apply fix
2. ✅ **Test integrations page** - verify platforms appear
3. ✅ **Test Shopify connection flow**
4. ⏳ **Test Amazon connection flow**

### Short Term (This Week):
1. **Update Amazon integration page** to match Shopify's connection UI
2. **Migrate to unified platforms API** - replace old integration endpoints
3. **Add connection status indicators** - show real-time connection state
4. **Platform settings UI** - credentials management

### Medium Term (Next Week):
1. **Sync history viewer** - show sync logs and status
2. **Error handling improvements** - better error messages
3. **Connection testing** - test connection before finalizing
4. **Success screens** - confirmation after connection

## Technical Notes

### API Endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/platforms` - List registered platforms (FIXED)
- ✅ `/api/platforms/[platform]` - Get platform status
- ✅ `/api/platforms/[platform]` POST - Connect to platform
- ✅ `/api/platforms/[platform]` DELETE - Disconnect
- ✅ `/api/platforms/[platform]/sync` POST - Trigger sync

### Component Structure:
- `apps/console/app/p/[slug]/integrations/page.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `apps/console/components/platforms/PlatformCard.tsx` - Platform cards
- `apps/console/components/platforms/IntegrationStats.tsx` - Stats overview
- `apps/console/lib/api-client.ts` - API client functions
