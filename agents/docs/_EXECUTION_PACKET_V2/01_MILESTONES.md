# Milestones — V2 (E‑Comm Focus)
_Milestone-based; no calendars. Each milestone unlocks the next._

## Legend
- Owners: **Platform** (infra/schema), **Connectors**, **Engine**, **Interface**, **Copilot**
- Types: [NR] = No‑regrets platform layer, [MW] = Market‑wedge specific

---

### M0.1 — Core Schema Validated [NR] — Owners: Platform
**Goals**
- JSON Schema registry + Prisma models for `Product`, `PriceVersion`, `DiscountPolicy`, `PriceChange`, `Event`, `Audit`.
- Deterministic migrations; seed data; RLS policies.

**Success**
- `pnpm test:db` passes with RLS on; schema semver tagged; DTOs published to `@calibr/types`.

---

### M0.2 — Event Bus (Append‑Only + Outbox) [NR] — Owners: Platform
**Goals**
- `event_log` + outbox tables; idempotent publisher; retry/backoff; dead‑letter queue.

**Success**
- Synthetic events flow through outbox; replay works; connector adapters consume.

---

### M0.3 — Shopify Connector (Read/Write) [MW] — Owners: Connectors
**Goals**
- Ingest products/variants; write price updates; health endpoints; rate‑limit handling.

**Success**
- Real tenant ingest; write-back applies a single price change and surfaces audit.
- ✅ Shopify apply flow hardened with retries, sanitized health telemetry, and structured event logging (Agent B — Codex).

---

### M0.4 — Amazon Connector (Read‑Only Stub) [NR→MW later] — Owners: Connectors ✅ COMPLETE
**Goals**
- SP‑API auth scaffolding; catalog ingest for schema stress test (no write).

**Success**
- Sample Amazon catalog rows visible in console; no write paths; flags disabled in prod.
- ✅ SP-API OAuth scaffolding implemented with LWA client
- ✅ Catalog ingest cron endpoint with database persistence
- ✅ Feature flag system (`AMAZON_CONNECTOR_ENABLED`) operational
- ✅ All 8 unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Database schema validated for multi-connector support
- ✅ Dry-run mode operational for safe testing without credentials
- ✅ Write path support confirmed (price feeds, competitive pricing)
- ✅ Comprehensive acceptance report created (`M0.4_ACCEPTANCE_REPORT.md`)

**Completed:** November 10, 2025 (M0.4)

---

### M1.1 — Pricing Engine MVP (Rules) [MW] — Owners: Engine
**Goals**
- Rule DSL: selector (predicate) + transform (%, absolute, floors/ceilings); schedule; dry‑run.
- `preview -> approve/apply -> rollback` lifecycle; idempotent apply.

**Success**
- Merchant executes a rule-based bulk price change with explain traces + audit events.

---

### M1.2 — Console (Catalog + Rules) [MW] — Owners: Interface
**Goals**
- Catalog table (filters/search); rule builder; diff preview; action bar; status/audit drawer.

**Success**
- End-to-end UX from rule creation to apply/rollback; reflects live state.
- ✅ Complete Console MVP delivered with 46+ tests (PR #53).

---

### M1.3 — Explainability + Audit Surfaces [NR] — Owners: Platform + Engine
**Goals**
- Persist `explain_trace` for previews/applies; `/audit` API; correlation ids across layers.

**Success**
- Any rule/application can be reconstructed from audit + events; traces are human‑readable.
- ✅ Complete audit trail implemented with correlation IDs, event replay, and sample reports (PR #54).

---

### M1.4 — Copilot Read‑Only Queries [NR] — Owners: Copilot ✅ COMPLETE
**Goals**
- `/copilot/query` endpoint; schema-aware RAG; safe prompt → SQL/GraphQL; RBAC.

**Success**
- Queries like "List products with price > $100" and "Show changes scheduled next week" succeed; query + sources logged.
- ✅ Complete copilot with AI-powered NL→SQL, RBAC, anomaly detection, and 42+ tests (PR #57).
- ✅ Queries like "List products with price > $100" and "Show changes scheduled next week" succeed; query + sources logged.
- ✅ Implemented `/api/v1/copilot` endpoint with GPT-4 integration and pattern-based fallback
- ✅ RBAC enforcement with project membership and role validation
- ✅ SQL injection guards (read-only queries only)
- ✅ Query logging with `CopilotQueryLog` table for full audit trail
- ✅ Analytics digest cron job with anomaly detection (price spikes, margin compression, volatility)
- ✅ Console UI with `CopilotDrawer` and `CopilotButton` components
- ✅ 18+ comprehensive tests covering RBAC, query logging, and anomaly detection

**Completed:** January 2025 (M1.4)

### Ready‑For‑Automation Gate [NR] — 7/8 Requirements Met
**Checklist**
- ✅ Engine supports schedule + revert
- ✅ Audit/explain complete
- ✅ Console shows lineage
- ✅ Connectors resilient (retry/backoff)
- ✅ Error surfacing
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ **Amazon validation complete** — M0.4 validated with 100% test pass
- 🟡 **Competitor E2E testing** — Manual testing in progress

**Outcome**
- Green‑light **Automation Runner** + **Copilot Simulation** in the next packet (pending competitor E2E completion).
