# Kickoff Checklist — Next 30 Days (Execution Packet V2 Continuation)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR AGENTS AND EXECUTORS**
>
> **This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for tracking milestone progress.**
>
> When completing tasks:
> 1. **UPDATE THIS FILE DIRECTLY** by marking tasks as `[x]` when completed
> 2. **DO NOT create separate tracking documents** (completion summaries are for documentation only, not tracking)
> 3. **COMMIT AND PUSH** your updates immediately after completing each milestone
> 4. **REFERENCE** completion summary documents (like `M0.X_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`) when updating, but track progress HERE
>
> This ensures all team members and agents have a single, up-to-date view of project progress.
