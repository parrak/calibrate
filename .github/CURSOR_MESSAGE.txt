🔍 CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK - Critical Issue Detected

Great systematic work so far! However, we need to pause and assess before continuing.

⚠️ CRITICAL: Error count increased from 100+ to 183 errors after your fixes. This suggests either:
1. New errors introduced by recent changes
2. Cascading type errors from schema mismatches
3. Initial count was inaccurate

📊 REQUIRED: Run full diagnostic NOW (don't skip this)

```bash
echo "=== ERROR COUNT ==="
pnpm typecheck 2>&1 | grep "Found [0-9]* error"

echo -e "\n=== TOP 5 ERROR FILES ==="
pnpm typecheck 2>&1 | grep "error TS" | cut -d'(' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5

echo -e "\n=== TOP 5 ERROR TYPES ==="
pnpm typecheck 2>&1 | grep "error TS" | sed 's/.*error \(TS[0-9]*\).*/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5

echo -e "\n=== RECENT COMMITS ==="
git log --oneline -5
```

Share the output, then I'll guide you on the best path forward.

🔀 TWO PATHS AVAILABLE:

PATH A (Continue): If <100 errors and concentrated in 2-3 files
- Fix auth-security.ts (add requireTenant)
- Fix staging-database.ts (remove non-existent fields)
- Fix performance-monitor.ts (add type annotations)
- Time: 2-4 hours

PATH B (Emergency Fallback - RECOMMENDED): Create minimal PR with just Vercel fix
- Cherry-pick only essential commits (Vercel fix, schema restore, workflow fix)
- Get critical deployment fix merged TODAY
- Address TypeScript cleanup in separate PR tomorrow
- Time: 20 minutes

📝 WHY PATH B IS RECOMMENDED:
- PR #2 has scope creep (was docs/scripts, became major refactor)
- 183 errors suggests deeper schema issues needing investigation
- Vercel fix is 90% of the value
- Smaller PR = safer, easier to review
- You can tackle TypeScript cleanup with fresh eyes in focused PR

⏸️ STOP NEW FIXES until you run the diagnostic and choose a path.

Run the command block above now, then reply with:
- Total errors: [X]
- Top error file: [filename]
- Decision: Path [A or B]
