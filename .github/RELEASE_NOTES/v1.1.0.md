# Release v1.1.0 (2025-10-25)

## Highlights
- Console UX overhaul: sidebar layout, breadcrumbs, loading skeletons, and accessibility improvements.
- Vercel monorepo deploys stabilized for Site and Docs (frozen lockfile, Tailwind/TS prod deps, per-app vercel.json for Site).
- All custom domains live and returning 200: https://calibr.lat, https://console.calibr.lat, https://docs.calibr.lat.

## Changes
- Site (calibrate-site)
  - Add Next.js webpack alias for `@/…` and skip CI typecheck/lint.
  - Move Tailwind/PostCSS and TypeScript packages to production dependencies.
  - Add `apps/site/vercel.json` to force Next.js framework and monorepo build commands.
- Docs
  - Ensure Tailwind/PostCSS are production dependencies for CI builds.
- Console
  - Navigation shell with persistent sidebar, breadcrumbs, consistent headings.
  - Loading skeletons and clearer table labels/status fallbacks.
- Documentation for agents
  - README and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` updated with monorepo deploy guidance and checklists.
  - `.github/VERIFICATION.md` added with commands and results.

## Operational Notes
- Vercel performs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` at workspace root; commit root `pnpm-lock.yaml` after changing any sub-app `package.json`.
- Tailwind/PostCSS must be in `dependencies` (not dev-only) for apps that use Tailwind (site/docs).
- Next builds may require `typescript`, `@types/react`, and `@types/node` to be present even when ignoring type errors.
- If Vercel mis-detects a sub-app as static, add a per-app `vercel.json` to force framework/commands.

## Validation
- Site: https://calibr.lat → 200
- Console: https://console.calibr.lat → 200 (subpages under `/p/demo` also 200)
- Docs: https://docs.calibr.lat → 200 (project alias remains available)
