- [x] Forward Next route context in withSecurity/withCORS for dynamic routes
- [x] Switch API route Prisma usage to prisma() and reuse db instance
- [ ] Verify runtime filesystem via Railway exec (list @prisma and .prisma paths)
- [ ] Add a temporary diag route if needed, then remove
- [ ] Close out handoff as resolved in docs
