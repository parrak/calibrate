# Phase 3: Agent Quick Start Guide

**Purpose:** Fast onboarding for the three agents working on Phase 3
**Read Time:** 5 minutes
**Phase Duration:** 2-3 weeks

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Mission

You are one of three agents working in parallel to build **Platform Integrations** for the Calibrate smart pricing platform. Your job is to build your assigned connector package **independently** while coordinating async with the other two agents.

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Structure

```
Phase 3 Team (3 Agents, Parallel Development)
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent A â†’ Shopify Connector
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent B â†’ Amazon Connector
â””â”€â”€ Agent C â†’ Platform Abstraction
```

**Key Point:** You can work completely independently. No blocking dependencies between agents during development.

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/phase3-platform-abstraction
```

2. **Read your detailed spec:**

mkdir -p packages/platform-connector/src/{types,interfaces,registry,utils}
mkdir -p packages/platform-connector/tests
cd packages/platform-connector
pnpm init
```

4. **PRIORITY TASK (Day 1-2):**
   Define and publish interfaces so Agent A and B can start implementing:
   - `PlatformConnector` interface
   - `ProductOperations` interface
   - `PricingOperations` interface
   - `AuthOperations` interface

5. **Daily coordination:**
   - Update [PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md](PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md) at end of each day
   - Post interface definitions for Agent A & B to review
   - Answer questions about interfaces and architecture

### Your Deliverables

**Code:**
- [ ] Base type definitions
- [ ] Platform connector interfaces
- [ ] Connector registry
- [ ] Connector factory
- [ ] Data normalization utilities
- [ ] Full test coverage

**Database:**
- [ ] `PlatformIntegration` model
- [ ] `PlatformSyncLog` model
- [ ] Migration files

**API Routes:**
- [ ] `/api/platforms` (list all)
- [ ] `/api/platforms/[platform]/connect`
- [ ] `/api/platforms/[platform]/status`
- [ ] `/api/platforms/[platform]/sync`

**UI:**
- [ ] `PlatformCard` component
- [ ] `PlatformList` component
- [ ] `ConnectionStatus` component
- [ ] Main integrations dashboard

**Docs:**
- [ ] `packages/platform-connector/README.md`
- [ ] Interface documentation
- [ ] "How to add a new platform" guide

### Success Criteria
âœ… Clean, well-documented interfaces
âœ… Registry can register/retrieve connectors

- **All agents**: Agree on final interfaces
- **Agent C**: Publish locked interfaces
- **Agent A & B**: Begin implementation against interfaces

**Day 4-5: Independent Development**
- **All agents**: Work independently on your packages
- **All agents**: Daily updates in PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md

### Week 2: Implementation & Integration

**Day 6-10:**
- Continue independent development
- Begin integration testing
- Help each other with questions

**Day 10: Mid-phase checkpoint**
- All agents: Verify basic integration works
- Test that connectors implement interfaces correctly

### Week 3: Polish & Merge

**Day 11-14:**
- Bug fixes and polish

   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git merge master  # Keep your branch up to date
   ```

2. **Work:** Build your assigned features
   - Write code
   - Write tests (aim for 95%+ coverage)
   - Run tests: `pnpm test`

3. **Coordinate:** Check PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md
   - Read updates from other agents
   - Answer any questions directed at you
   - Note any blockers or interface changes

4. **End:** Update PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md
   - Post what you completed
   - Post what's blocking you
   - Post your plan for tomorrow
   - Ask questions if needed

5. **Commit:** Save your progress
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(phase3): [what you did]"
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

## ðŸš« Blockers & How to Handle Them

### If You're Blocked:

1. **Post immediately** in PHASE3_DAILY_LOG.md
2. **Tag the agent** who can unblock you
3. **Propose a workaround** you can do in the meantime
4. **Continue with other tasks** while waiting

### Common Blockers:

**"I need the interfaces from Agent C"**
- **Timeline:** Agent C will publish by Day 2-3
- **Workaround:** Set up package structure, write tests, read docs

**"I need to know how Agent A/B does X"**
- **Post question** in daily log
- **Check their code** if their branch is pushed
- **Propose your approach** and ask for validation

**"The interface doesn't support my use case"**
- **Post specific issue** with example
- **Propose interface change** with reasoning
- **Wait for agreement** from all three agents before changing

**Remember:**
- Work independently
- Communicate daily
- Help each other
- Stay focused on your deliverables

**Good luck! ðŸš€**
