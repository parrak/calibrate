# Quick Fix Summary - Integrations Page

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issue:** Integrations page showing "Failed to fetch" error  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## What Was Wrong

The integrations page (`/p/[slug]/integrations`) was showing:

- No platforms available
- All counts showing 0

**Root Cause:** Shopify connector wasn't being registered in the API.

Added this line:
```typescript
import '@calibr/shopify-connector'  // Auto-registers Shopify on import
```

**Also Enhanced:** Better platform names and descriptions in the API response.

## Testing

1. Restart API server: `cd apps/api && pnpm dev`
2. Visit: `/p/[slug]/integrations`
3. Should see both Shopify and Amazon platforms listed
