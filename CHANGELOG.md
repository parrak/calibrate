## [Unreleased]

### Added - Phase 2: Competitor Monitoring

**Web Scraping Infrastructure:**
- Implemented Shopify price scraper using JSON product API for reliable data extraction
- Implemented Amazon price scraper (stub with API integration guidance)
- Implemented Google Shopping price scraper (stub with Content API/SerpAPI integration guidance)
- Created auto-detection system to identify channel from product URLs
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all scraper utilities (31 passing tests)

**UI Enhancements:**
- Added Competitor Analytics dashboard component with market insights:
  - Market position indicators (lowest/highest/middle)
  - Average market price tracking
  - Price spread analysis
  - Per-product competitor price comparisons
- Updated competitors page with 3-tab layout: Monitor, Analytics, Rules
- Enhanced competitor monitoring UI with real-time price tracking

**Database & Seeding:**
- Extended seed script with demo competitor data:
  - 2 demo competitors (Competitor A & Competitor B)
  - Competitor products mapped to PRO-MONTHLY and ENT-MONTHLY SKUs
  - Competitor price history with sale indicators
  - Demo competitor rule: "Beat Competition by 5%"

**Architecture:**
- Updated `CompetitorMonitor` class to use channel-specific scrapers
- Improved error handling and logging for scraping operations
- Added scraper package structure: `packages/competitor-monitoring/scrapers/`

See [COMPETITOR_MONITORING.md](COMPETITOR_MONITORING.md) for detailed feature documentation.

### Planned
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Staging environment setup
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Rate limiting implementation
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Performance optimization
- Phase 3: E-commerce platform integrations (Shopify, Amazon, Google Shopping APIs)

### Fixed
- Align PNPM version with lockfile for Docker/Railway builds.
  - Pin `packageManager` to `pnpm@9.0.0` to match `lockfileVersion: '9.0'`.
  - Use Corepack in Dockerfile (`corepack prepare pnpm@9.0.0 --activate`) instead of `pnpm@latest` to prevent lockfile incompatibility errors.



## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- Console UX: sidebar layout, breadcrumbs, loading skeletons, accessibility tweaks.
- Site build: resolve TS path alias, skip typecheck/lint in CI, prod deps for Tailwind/TS.
- Docs build: prod deps for Tailwind/PostCSS, lockfile guidance.

### Changed
- README and agent instructions updated with Vercel monorepo deploy steps and frozen lockfile caveat.

### Fixes
- Vercel deployments stabilized by committing updated root pnpm-lock.yaml after sub-app dependency changes.
