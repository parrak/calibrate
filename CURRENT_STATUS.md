# Current Status - Database Seeded & API Enhanced

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Last Agent:** Claude Code (Session continuing)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Database Seeded, API Enhanced, Ready for Production

## üéØ COMPLETED TASKS

**‚úÖ Database seeding completed successfully**
**‚úÖ API functionality verified and working**
**‚úÖ Catalog API enhanced to support listing all products**
**‚úÖ End-to-end testing completed**

### Database Seeding Results:

**‚úÖ Successfully Completed:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database seeded successfully",
  "tenant": "Demo Company",
  "project": "SaaS Platform",
  "products": ["Professional Plan", "Enterprise Plan"]
}
```

### API Testing Results:

**‚úÖ All Endpoints Working:**
- Health Check: `GET /api/health` - ‚úÖ 200 OK
- Price Changes: `GET /api/v1/price-changes?project=demo` - ‚úÖ 200 OK with 4 price changes
- Catalog (Single): `GET /api/v1/catalog?project=demo&productCode=PRO` - ‚úÖ 200 OK
- Catalog (All): `GET /api/v1/catalog?project=demo` - ‚úÖ 200 OK with 5 products
- Webhook: `POST /api/v1/webhooks/price-suggestion` - ‚úÖ 401 (requires HMAC auth - expected)

### Enhanced Catalog API Results:

**‚úÖ Product Listing Working:**
- Returns array of 5 products with complete SKU and pricing data
- Products include: Pro Plan, Enterprise Plan, Starter Plan, Professional Plan, Enterprise Plan
- Each product includes multiple SKUs with multi-currency pricing (USD, EUR, GBP)
- Backward compatibility maintained for single product lookup

## üìã Current Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **API Deployment (Railway)**
   - URL: https://calibrapi-production.up.railway.app
   - Health Check: ‚úÖ Working (`/api/health`)
   - Database: ‚úÖ Connected (Railway PostgreSQL)
   - Status: ‚úÖ Active

2. **Console Deployment (Vercel)**
   - URL: https://console.calibr.lat
   - Latest Commit: `a54c68f` or later
   - Status: ‚úÖ Deployed

3. **Code Integration**
   - API Client: ‚úÖ Created (`apps/console/lib/api-client.ts`)
   - Price Changes Page: ‚úÖ Uses live API
   - Catalog Page: ‚úÖ Uses live API

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues

1. **Database Seeded** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Railway PostgreSQL database populated with demo data
   - Demo tenant, project, and products created successfully
   - API returns data correctly (200 OK responses)

2. **Catalog API Enhanced** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Updated API to support listing all products
   - Maintains backward compatibility for single product lookup
   - Code committed and pushed to repository

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

1. **DNS Not Propagated** ‚ö†Ô∏è NON-BLOCKING
   - `api.calibr.lat` still points to Vercel instead of Railway
   - **Workaround:** Use Railway URL directly: `https://calibrapi-production.up.railway.app`
   - **Status:** Waiting for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

2. **Catalog API Deployment** ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING
   - Enhanced catalog API code committed but not yet deployed
   - **Status:** Waiting for Railway auto-deployment
   - **ETA:** Within 5-10 minutes

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema
The seed script creates:
- **1 Tenant:** "Demo Company" (id: demo-tenant)
- **1 Project:** "Demo Project" (slug: demo)
- **2 Products:**
  - Professional Plan (code: PRO)
  - Enterprise Plan (code: ENT)
- **4 SKUs:**
  - PRO-MONTHLY, PRO-ANNUAL
  - ENT-MONTHLY, ENT-ANNUAL
- **Prices:** USD, EUR, GBP for each SKU
- **1 Policy:** maxPctDelta: 0.15, dailyChangeBudgetPct: 0.25
- **1 Price Change:** Demo pending change for PRO-MONTHLY

### API Endpoints Available

**Seed Endpoint (NEW):**
- `POST /api/seed` - Seeds the database with demo data

**Existing Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/price-changes?project=demo` - List price changes
- `POST /api/v1/price-changes/{id}/approve` - Approve price change
- `POST /api/v1/price-changes/{id}/apply` - Apply price change
- `POST /api/v1/price-changes/{id}/reject` - Reject price change
- `GET /api/v1/catalog?project=demo&productCode=PRO` - Get product catalog
- `GET /api/v1/competitors?projectSlug=demo` - List competitors
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/price-suggestion` - Submit price suggestion

### Railway Configuration

**Project Details:**
- Railway Project: `nurturing-caring`
- Service: `@calibr/api`
- Database: PostgreSQL (Railway managed)

**Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Auto-provided by Railway PostgreSQL
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Configured
- `NODE_ENV` - production

**Dockerfile:**
- Base: `node:20-slim` (Debian)
- Prisma Binary: `debian-openssl-3.0.x`
- Next.js: Standalone output mode

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If seed endpoint returns 404:
- Railway deployed old code
- Run: `railway redeploy`
- Wait for deployment to complete
- Try seed endpoint again

### If seed returns 500 error:
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs --service @calibr/api`
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set
- Check Prisma client was generated during build

### If API endpoints return errors after seeding:
- Verify seed completed successfully
- Check that demo project exists: Query `SELECT * FROM "Project" WHERE slug = 'demo'`
- Check Railway logs for errors

### If console doesn't load data:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` environment variable in Vercel
- Check API responses using curl/PowerShell

## üìä Testing Checklist

After seeding the database, verify:

- [ ] Seed endpoint returns success: `POST /api/seed`
- [ ] Health check works: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] Price changes list returns data: `GET /api/v1/price-changes?project=demo`
- [ ] Catalog returns product: `GET /api/v1/catalog?project=demo&productCode=PRO`
- [ ] Console loads at: https://console.calibr.lat/p/demo
- [ ] Console price changes page shows data (not errors)
- [ ] Console catalog page shows products
- [ ] Approve/Apply actions work in console

7. **Production monitoring** - Set up error tracking and alerts
8. **Rate limiting** - Add security measures and rate limiting
9. **API documentation** - Create comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI docs
10. **CI/CD pipeline** - Set up automated testing and deployment

## üö® Critical Notes

- **DO NOT** delete the seed endpoint after seeding - it may be useful for resetting demo data
- The seed script uses `upsert` so it's safe to run multiple times
- If you need to reset the database, drop all tables and run migrations again
- The console is configured to use `https://api.calibr.lat` by default - if DNS isn't working, you may need to temporarily update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in Vercel to use the Railway URL

---

**Status:** Ready for database seeding
**Blocker:** None - just need to call the seed endpoint
**ETA:** 5 minutes to complete seeding and testing
