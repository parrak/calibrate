## 7. Known Limitations

### Vercel Deployment Limit

- **Issue:** Free tier limit of 100 deployments/day reached
- **Impact:** Cannot manually trigger Vercel deployments until limit resets
- **Workaround:** Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub pushes
- **Resolution:** Limit resets in ~3 hours, or upgrade to paid plan
- **Status:** ⚠️ Minor - console is accessible and functional

### Competitor API Authentication

- **Issue:** Competitor endpoints require HMAC authentication
- **Impact:** Cannot test endpoints directly via browser/Postman without signing requests
- **Workaround:** Use the admin console UI or properly sign requests
- **Status:** ✅ Expected behavior (security feature)

## 10. Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered in production:

### Rollback Git Commits

```bash
# Revert to pre-Phase 2 state
git revert d3e660b..HEAD
git push origin master
```

### Railway Redeployment

Railway will auto-deploy the reverted code.

### Database Rollback

If competitor tables cause issues:

```bash
# Connect to Railway database
railway run --service @calibr/api -- npx prisma migrate reset

# Re-apply migrations up to pre-Phase 2 state
# (Migration rollback specific instructions would go here)
```

**Note:** Database rollback is destructive. Only use if absolutely necessary.
