## üéØ Communication Guidelines

### When to Post

### What to Include
‚úÖ **Do Include:**
- Concrete progress (files created, tests passing)
- Specific blockers with context
- Questions that need answers within 24 hours
- Interface or API changes that affect others

‚ùå **Don't Include:**

3. Propose workaround or alternative approach
