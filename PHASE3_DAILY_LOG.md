## üéØ Communication Guidelines

### When to Post
- **End of each work session** (at minimum once per day)
- **Immediately** when blocked
- **Immediately** when discovering an issue affecting other workstreams

### What to Include
‚úÖ **Do Include:**
- Concrete progress (files created, tests passing)
- Specific blockers with context
- Questions that need answers within 24 hours
- Interface or API changes that affect others

‚ùå **Don't Include:**
- Vague status updates ("working on stuff")
- Implementation details that don't affect others
- Questions that can be answered by documentation

### Response Time Expectations
- **Blocking Questions:** Response within 4 hours
- **General Questions:** Response within 24 hours
- **Interface Changes:** Must be discussed and agreed upon

### Escalation Path
If blocked for >24 hours:
1. Post clearly in "Blockers" section
2. Tag specific agent(s) needed for unblocking
3. Propose workaround or alternative approach

## üìù Template Instructions

### For Agents:

2. **Fill in your section** at the end of your work session
3. **Read other agents' updates** before starting work
4. **Respond to questions** directed at you within 24 hours
5. **Keep it concise** - focus on what others need to know

### For Coordination:

The human project owner should:
- Review this log daily
- Help resolve blockers
- Make final decisions on disputed interface changes
- Ensure all three workstreams stay aligned

Agent B Update ‚Äî 2025-10-25

- Merged Amazon connector feature to master (SP-API pricing feed scaffold, AES-256-GCM encryption/upload, optional submit)
- Added platform API endpoints:
  - POST /api/platforms/amazon/pricing
  - GET /api/platforms/amazon/pricing/status
- Console UI page for submit/poll: /p/demo/integrations/amazon/pricing
- Tests passing: platform-connector (47), amazon-connector (7), api (15)

@Agent C: Registry integration consumed successfully. Routes call ConnectorRegistry and use your types. No action needed on your side.

---

Agent B Update ‚Äî 2025-10-26

- Auth integration groundwork for local dev:
  - API: added POST /api/auth/session to issue Bearer tokens for Console ‚Üí API calls (guarded by CONSOLE_INTERNAL_TOKEN)
  - Console: on sign-in, requests API token in NextAuth jwt callback; exposes session.apiToken
- Console UI: added API auth check section on the Amazon pricing page
- Local run scripts updated to start API on 3000 and Console on 3001; env examples updated with CONSOLE_INTERNAL_TOKEN

Known issue (WIP):
- Console login build error with NextAuth v5 import paths under dev/webpack
- Next steps: finalize NextAuth imports (server vs client), verify providers import path, then validate end-to-end

Handoff to Agent C ‚Äî 2025-10-26

- Please pick up Console login stabilization per AGENT_C_HANDOFF.md
- Goal: /login works locally; session.apiToken populated; API auth check returns 200
- Focus: ensure imports match v5 (see handoff), single dev instance on 3001, clear caches
