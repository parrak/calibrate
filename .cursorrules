# Cursor Collaboration Rules (agents protocol)

- Read and write tasks under `calibrate/agents/tasks/`.
- Append-only to `inbox.jsonl`, `done.jsonl`, and `events/YYYYMMDD/<agent>.jsonl`.
- Use atomic writes: write temp file then rename.
- Claim a task by moving it from `inbox.jsonl` to `tasks/in_progress/<id>.json` and creating `locks/<id>.lock`.
- Do not edit other agentsâ€™ `in_progress` files; respect `locks/`.
- Include precise file references (path:line) in tasks/events whenever possible.
- Keep tasks small; include a clear `definition_of_done`.
- Prefer the helper: `node agents/bin/agents-cli.mjs` for claim, handoff, complete.
