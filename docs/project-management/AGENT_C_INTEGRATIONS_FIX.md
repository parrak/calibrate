# Integrations Page Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Issue Report

### Problem
User reported the integrations page showing:
- "Failed to fetch" error
- "No platforms available" message
- All stats showing 0 (Total Platforms: 0, Connected: 0, etc.)

### Expected Behavior
The integrations page should show:
- Available platforms: Shopify and Amazon
- Connection status for each platform
- Ability to connect new platforms
- Stats showing platform counts

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation
1. Checked `apps/console/app/p/[slug]/integrations/page.tsx`
   - Page calls `platformsApi.list()` which hits `/api/platforms`
   - Error handling catches failures and shows "Failed to fetch"

2. Checked `apps/api/app/api/platforms/route.ts`
   - Endpoint calls `ConnectorRegistry.getRegisteredPlatforms()`
   - Returns empty array when no platforms registered

3. Checked `apps/api/lib/platforms/register.ts`
   - **ISSUE FOUND:** Only Amazon connector was being registered
   - Shopify connector was NOT imported, so not registered
   - When page tried to list platforms, it got an empty array → "Failed to fetch"

### Why This Happened
The Shopify connector auto-registers on import (see `packages/shopify-connector/src/index.ts`), but it was never imported in the registration file. Only Amazon had an explicit registration function.

## Fix Applied

### Code Changes

**File:** `apps/api/lib/platforms/register.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { ConnectorRegistry } from '@calibr/platform-connector'
import { registerAmazonConnector } from '@calibr/amazon-connector'

export function registerKnownConnectors() {
  if (!ConnectorRegistry.isRegistered('amazon')) {
    registerAmazonConnector()
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { ConnectorRegistry } from '@calibr/platform-connector'
import { registerAmazonConnector } from '@calibr/amazon-connector'
// Import Shopify connector to trigger auto-registration
import '@calibr/shopify-connector'

export function registerKnownConnectors() {
  if (!ConnectorRegistry.isRegistered('amazon')) {
    registerAmazonConnector()
  }
  // Shopify auto-registers on import (see packages/shopify-connector/src/index.ts)
}
```

**Also Enhanced:** `apps/api/app/api/platforms/route.ts`
```typescript
// Added better platform metadata with names and descriptions
switch (platform) {
  case 'shopify':
    name = 'Shopify';
    description = 'Connect your Shopify store to manage products and pricing';
    break;
  case 'amazon':
    name = 'Amazon';
    description = 'Connect to Amazon Seller Central for product and pricing management';
    break;
  // ...
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### For Agent C

1. **Restart API Server:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Verify Registration:**
   - Check that both platforms are registered on startup
   - Look for logs showing platform registration

3. **Test Integrations Page:**
   - Navigate to `/p/[project-slug]/integrations`
   - Should see:
     - "Available Platforms" section
     - Both Shopify and Amazon platform cards
     - Connection status for each
     - No "Failed to fetch" error

4. **Verify API Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/platforms
   ```
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "platforms": [
       {
         "platform": "shopify",
         "name": "Shopify",
         "description": "Connect your Shopify store...",
         "available": true
       },
       {
         "platform": "amazon",
         "name": "Amazon",
         "description": "Connect to Amazon Seller Central...",
         "available": true
       }
     ],
     "count": 2
   }
   ```
