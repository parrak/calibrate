# Deployment Status - October 28, 2025

## Current Issue

User is seeing "Failed to fetch" on console.calibr.lat for the integrations page.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ API is Working Correctly

**Production API Endpoint:** `https://api.calibr.lat/api/platforms`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "shopify",
      "name": "Shopify",
      "description": "Connect your Shopify store to manage products and pricing",
      "available": true
    },
    {
      "platform": "amazon",
      "name": "Amazon",
      "description": "Connect to Amazon Seller Central for product and pricing management",
      "available": true
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

**Status:** ✅ API returns both platforms correctly

### ❌ Console Deployment Issue

**Production Console:** `console.calibr.lat`
**Issue:** Console has a build error causing "Failed to fetch"

**Error from Vercel:**
```
Failed to compile.

./components/platforms/PlatformCard.tsx

Error: Expression expected
Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <div>
```

**Fix Applied:** Commit `c4cb0be`
- Fixed JSX structure in PlatformCard.tsx
- Fixed missing closing div tags
- Corrected indentation for nested divs

## Status

### Code Status
- ✅ JSX fix committed and pushed
- ✅ Fix is in the repository
- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel to rebuild the console

### Expected Behavior After Rebuild
Once Vercel finishes rebuilding the console:
- Integrations page should load without "Failed to fetch" error
- Both Shopify and Amazon platforms should appear
- User should be able to click "Connect" on either platform
