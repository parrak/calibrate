Completed:
- `AGENTS.md` cleaned and expanded.
- `AGENT_STATUS.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `AGENTS_BROADCAST_2025-10-27.md` normalized.
- `apps/console/AGENTS.md`, `scripts/AGENTS.md` linked to hub.

Blockers:

Tomorrow's Plan:
- Review for any remaining malformed characters in non-status docs.

Refs: `AGENTS.md:1`, `STATUS_BROADCASTING.md:1`, `AGENT_STATUS.md:1`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md:1`

### Platform Routes Runtime
Agent: Codex
Status: Resolved by Agent C

Today's Progress:
- Investigated 500s on `/api/platforms/[platform]` in Railway (Prisma undefined models).

- Created handoff with investigation steps and acceptance criteria.

Blockers:
- None.

Next:
- Close out investigation; monitor deployment.

## Day 4 - October 31, 2025

### Workstream A: Shopify OAuth Flow & CORS Fixes
Agent: Agent A
Status: ✅ Complete - All Critical Issues Resolved

Today's Progress:
- [x] Fixed Shopify OAuth install route: Resolved 405 error caused by const variable reassignment bug
- [x] Fixed Shopify OAuth callback: Added missing `platformName` parameter in POST request
- [x] Fixed CORS issues: Added `withSecurity` middleware and OPTIONS handler to sync endpoint
- [x] Fixed ShopifyStatus component: Made `onUpdate` prop optional, added local state management
- [x] Fixed ShopifyConnector initialization: Properly pass `shopDomain` and `accessToken` to client
- [x] Fixed ShopifyClient: Use credentials-based shop domain and access token (not API key)
- [x] Fixed console auth: Corrected `getServerSession` import for NextAuth v4 compatibility
- [x] Added DisconnectButton component for Shopify integration UI
- [x] Improved error handling in sync endpoint with proper project slug resolution
- [x] Added test scripts for OAuth flow validation (`test-oauth-local.ps1`)
- [x] Organized documentation into structured directories (`docs/learnings/`, `docs/misc/`, `docs/project-management/`)

Completed:
- ✅ Shopify OAuth install endpoint (no more 405 errors)
- ✅ Shopify OAuth callback flow (saves integration correctly)
- ✅ CORS support for cross-origin requests (console → API)
- ✅ Shopify connection testing (test_connection action works)
- ✅ UI components for Shopify integration management
- ✅ Error handling and status updates in UI
- ✅ Database migrations applied (ShopifyIntegration table exists)

Key Files Modified:
- `apps/api/app/api/platforms/shopify/oauth/install/route.ts` - Fixed const reassignment bug
- `apps/api/app/api/platforms/shopify/oauth/callback/route.ts` - Added platformName to POST
- `apps/api/app/api/integrations/shopify/sync/route.ts` - Added CORS, projectSlug support
- `apps/api/app/api/platforms/[platform]/route.ts` - Fixed connector initialization
- `apps/console/app/p/[slug]/integrations/shopify/components/ShopifyStatus.tsx` - Fixed state management
- `apps/console/app/p/[slug]/integrations/shopify/components/ShopifyAuthButton.tsx` - Fixed imports
- `apps/console/app/p/[slug]/integrations/shopify/components/DisconnectButton.tsx` - New component
- `packages/shopify-connector/src/ShopifyConnector.ts` - Fixed initialization
- `packages/shopify-connector/src/client.ts` - Use credentials for shop domain/token

Key Files Created:
- `apps/console/app/p/[slug]/integrations/shopify/components/DisconnectButton.tsx`
- `apps/api/tests/platforms/shopify/oauth.install.test.ts`
- `apps/api/tests/platforms/shopify/oauth.callback.test.ts`
- `test-oauth-local.ps1`
- `test-shopify-oauth-e2e.ps1`
- `docs/learnings/CORS_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- Multiple documentation files organized into docs/ structure

Issues Resolved:
1. **405 Method Not Allowed** - Fixed const variable reassignment preventing route from loading
2. **Failed to save integration** - Fixed missing platformName parameter and connector initialization
3. **Failed to connect to platform** - Fixed ShopifyClient using wrong shop domain and token
4. **CORS errors** - Added withSecurity middleware and OPTIONS handler
5. **onUpdate is not a function** - Made prop optional and added local state management
6. **Connection test failed** - Fixed projectSlug resolution and sync endpoint configuration
7. **getServerSession is not a function** - Fixed NextAuth v4 import compatibility

Testing Results:
- ✅ OAuth install endpoint: Returns 200 with correct authorization URL
- ✅ OAuth callback: Successfully saves integration to database
- ✅ CORS preflight (OPTIONS): Returns 200 with correct CORS headers
- ✅ CORS POST request: Returns 200 with CORS headers when tested
- ✅ Connection test: Successfully connects to Shopify API
- ✅ Database: ShopifyIntegration table exists and migrations applied

Blockers:
- None - All critical issues resolved

Questions for Other Agents:
- @Agent C: CORS middleware is working correctly with `withSecurity`. Sync endpoint now properly handles cross-origin requests.
- @All Agents: Documentation has been reorganized into `docs/learnings/`, `docs/misc/`, and `docs/project-management/` for better navigation.

Next Session Plan:
- Test end-to-end OAuth flow in production
- Verify production deployment with Railway environment variables
- Add additional error handling for edge cases
- Consider adding webhook setup automation
- Monitor production sync operations
