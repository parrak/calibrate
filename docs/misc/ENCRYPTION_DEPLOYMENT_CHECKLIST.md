# Encryption Deployment Checklist

**Status:** Ready for Production Deployment
**Date:** October 28, 2025

---

## Pre-Deployment

- [x] Encryption implementation complete
- [x] 22 unit tests passing
- [x] Migration script created with dry-run mode
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Production encryption key generated
- [x] Key stored securely (not in git)
- [x] Migration script executable via pnpm

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Add ENCRYPTION_KEY to Railway

**Command:**
```bash
railway variables set ENCRYPTION_KEY=NtxoLQbx7XMqZqmqfN3Nla2DmY2vsCDmELzSNlE5N2Y=
```

**Verification:**
```bash
railway variables | grep ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

Expected: `ENCRYPTION_KEY=NtxoLQbx7XMqZqmqfN3Nla2DmY2vsCDmELzSNlE5N2Y=`

---

### 2. Deploy API with Encryption Middleware

**Railway will auto-deploy from git push, or manually:**
```bash
railway up
```

**Wait for deployment to complete, then verify:**
```bash
curl https://api.calibr.lat/api/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok"}`

---

### 3. Backup Database (Before Migration)

```bash
railway db backup create
```

Note the backup ID for rollback if needed.

---

### 4. Run Migration Script (Dry Run First)

**Test with dry run:**
```bash
railway run pnpm encrypt:credentials:dry
```

**Expected output:**
```
üîê Credential Encryption Migration
===================================
Mode: DRY RUN (no changes will be made)

Found 2 integrations with credentials

‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping amazon (abc123) - already encrypted
‚úÖ Would encrypt shopify (def456)

Migration Summary
=================
Total integrations: 2
Encrypted: 1
Skipped (already encrypted): 1
Errors: 0

‚ö†Ô∏è  This was a DRY RUN - no changes were made
Run without --dry-run to apply changes
```

---

### 5. Run Migration Script (Live)

**If dry run looks good, run for real:**
```bash
railway run pnpm encrypt:credentials --verbose
```

**Expected output:**
```
üîê Credential Encryption Migration
===================================
Mode: LIVE

Found 2 integrations with credentials

‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping amazon (abc123) - already encrypted
‚úÖ Encrypted shopify (def456)

Migration Summary
=================
Total integrations: 2
Encrypted: 1
Skipped (already encrypted): 1
Errors: 0

‚úÖ Migration completed successfully!
```

---

### 6. Verify Encryption Works

**Test platform integrations endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://api.calibr.lat/api/platforms
```

Should return platforms list without errors.

**Test a specific integration (if you have one):**
```bash
curl https://api.calibr.lat/api/integrations/[integration-id]
```

Should decrypt credentials automatically via middleware.

---

### 7. Check Logs for Errors

```bash
railway logs
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ No "ENCRYPTION_KEY not set" errors
- ‚úÖ No "Failed to decrypt" errors
- ‚úÖ No other encryption-related errors

---

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] ENCRYPTION_KEY added to Railway
- [ ] API deployed and healthy
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Migration script ran successfully (dry run)
- [ ] Migration script ran successfully (live)
- [ ] No decryption errors in logs
- [ ] `/api/platforms` endpoint works
- [ ] `/api/health` shows healthy

---

## Backup Key in 1Password

**Create entry in 1Password:**

```
Title: Calibrate Encryption Key - Production
Type: Password
Username: production
Password: NtxoLQbx7XMqZqmqfN3Nla2DmY2vsCDmELzSNlE5N2Y=
URL: https://railway.app
Notes:
  Generated: October 27, 2025
  Environment: Production
  Purpose: Platform credential encryption
  Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
  Next rotation: January 27, 2026
  Railway Project: [your-project-id]
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Option 1: Restore Database Backup

```bash
# List backups
railway db backup list

# Restore specific backup
railway db backup restore [backup-id]
```

### Option 2: Remove ENCRYPTION_KEY

If decryption fails but you need the API running:

```bash
# Remove key temporarily
railway variables unset ENCRYPTION_KEY

# Redeploy
railway up
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This will break credential decryption but allows API to run.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable not set"

**Solution:**
```bash
railway variables set ENCRYPTION_KEY=NtxoLQbx7XMqZqmqfN3Nla2DmY2vsCDmELzSNlE5N2Y=
railway up
```

### Error: "Failed to decrypt credentials"

**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong encryption key
2. Credentials not yet migrated
3. Database restored from old backup

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check if credentials are encrypted (format: hex:hex:hex)
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c 'SELECT id, platform, credentials FROM "PlatformIntegration" LIMIT 1'
```

### Migration Script Fails

**Recovery:**
1. Restore database backup
2. Check encryption key matches
3. Run with `--verbose` flag
4. Check error messages

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ ENCRYPTION_KEY set in Railway
2. ‚úÖ API deploys without errors
3. ‚úÖ Migration script completes without errors
4. ‚úÖ No decryption errors in logs
5. ‚úÖ Platform endpoints return data correctly
6. ‚úÖ Key backed up in 1Password

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Monitor logs for 24 hours for any decryption errors
2. Test creating new platform integrations (should auto-encrypt)
3. Update key in 1Password with deployment date
4. Schedule key rotation for 3 months (January 27, 2026)
5. Move to next security task: Audit logging
